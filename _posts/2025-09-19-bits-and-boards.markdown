<h3 class="emoji-title"> <span class="emoji">:package:</span> Manage Your Shop </h3>
Keep shelves filled with board-game classics, hot new TCG boosters, miniatures, and the most popular videogames. Use daily sales data and seasonal market trends to decide what—and how much—to reorder before popular items run out.


<h3 class="emoji-title"> <span class="emoji">:busts_in_silhouette:</span> Hire Staff & Automate </h3>
Cashiers speed up the queue, restock workers keep your shelves full and storage workers keep your boxes tidy. The right team lets the shop hum along even during peak hours.


<h3 class="emoji-title"> <span class="emoji">:star:</span> Satisfy Every Customer </h3> 
Shoppers walk in with budgets, wish-lists, and comfort needs. Meet (or miss) those requirements and they’ll leave glowing (or scathing) reviews that directly affect your store’s reputation.


<h3 class="emoji-title"> <span class="emoji">:hammer:</span> Expand & Upgrade </h3> 
Profits unlock new floor space, furniture, decorations and a variety or items to display in your shop. You can also customize your shop's appearance by changing your floor and wallpapers!


<h3 class="emoji-title"> <span class="emoji">:bar_chart:</span> Level Up & Perk Up! </h3>
As your store earns profits, it will level up and grant perk points. Spend these points to unlock powerful passive bonuses or brand-new features for your shop!
