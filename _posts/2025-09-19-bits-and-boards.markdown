### :package: Manage Your Shop  
Keep shelves filled with board-game classics, hot new TCG boosters, miniatures, and the most popular videogames. Use daily sales data and seasonal market trends to decide what—and how much—to reorder before popular items run out.


### Hire Staff & Automate  
Cashiers speed up the queue, restock workers keep your shelves full and storage workers keep your boxes tidy. The right team lets the shop hum along even during peak hours.


### Satisfy Every Customer  
Shoppers walk in with budgets, wish-lists, and comfort needs. Meet (or miss) those requirements and they’ll leave glowing (or scathing) reviews that directly affect your store’s reputation.


### Expand & Upgrade  
Profits unlock new floor space, furniture, decorations and a variety or items to display in your shop. You can also customize your shop's appearance by changing your floor and wallpapers!


### Level Up & Perk Up!
As your store earns profits, it will level up and grant perk points. Spend these points to unlock powerful passive bonuses or brand-new features for your shop!
