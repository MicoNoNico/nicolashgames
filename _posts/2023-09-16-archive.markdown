In "Enemies with Benefits" the Players compete against each other through various interactions which require either cooperation or betrayal.

Depending on the situation, players may decide to help each other out or try to win solo by impairing others at every turn.The game features an active ragdoll system, giving them a very “goofy” way of moving. 

The movement system itself is physics based and makes full use of the ragdoll to function. The game maps are randomly generated every session.
