<h2 class="about-title">Hi there, I’m Nico.</h2>

<p>
  I am a game developer with a strong foundation in Unity and C#, driven by a passion for strategy and management games.
</p>

<p>
  While I strive to be proficient across various fields, I enjoy creating games that blend clarity, complexity, and player agency, 
  and I'm motivated by crafting systems that grow, evolve, and reward thoughtful decision-making.
</p>  

<p>
  My recent work includes Bits and Boards – Game Store Simulator, a full-scale title I’m developing solo in Unity, 
  where I design and implement everything from AI-driven staff behaviours and dynamic customer systems to economy balancing, 
  UI/UX, and performance optimization.
</p>

<h2 class="about-title">So what can I do?</h2>

<p>
  My strongest expertise lies in Unity and C#, where I build scalable gameplay systems, AI behaviours, 
  UI frameworks, and full game loops from the ground up. Through my work on Bits and Boards, 
</p>

<p>
  I’ve gained deep experience architecting interconnected systems: AI with autonomous decision-making, 
  customer simulations driven by budgets and preferences, inventory and economy logic, data-driven progression, 
  and a perk tree that unlocks new layers of player strategy.
</p>

<p>
  Beyond programming, I’m able to independently design UI/UX, create 2D and 3D assets, iterate quickly, and manage 
  the full development life cycle of a project. Whether working solo or collaborating with others, I am able to utilize
  various tools to effectively communicate and collaborate with team members to turn complex ideas into systems that 
  feel rewarding for players.
